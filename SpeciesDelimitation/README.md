### Usage
The `R` script `plot.simmatrix.R` may be used within the DISSECT workflow (Jones *et al* 2015) for **species delimitation**. After running *BEAST* (Drummond *et al* 2012) or *STACEY* (Jones 2017) for *BEAST2* (Bouckaert *et al* 2014) to obtain a set of species trees, one can "summarize the posterior frequencies of clusterings" using *SpeciesDelimitationAnalyzer* (speciesDA.jar, http://www.indriid.com/software.html). The **similarity matrix** can then be visualized using the `R` function `plot.simmatrix`, which is an extension on Graham Jones' version of the code (see http://www.indriid.com/2014/species-delim-paper-SuppIinfo-v8.pdf), and allows for custom or automatic pairwise distance matrix sorting (using a summary tree topology in NEXUS format), labelling, and line drawing.

```
plot.simmatrix(speciesDAoutput, summarized.tree = NULL, labelfile = NULL, 
               ownorder = NULL, ownlines = NULL, PP.thresh = 0.05, 
               mar = c(0, 10, 10, 1), label.size = 1, legendlabel.size = 1, 
               cols = c("blue", "orange", "white"), border.col = NULL, legend = TRUE, 
               plot.phylo = FALSE, save.pdf = FALSE, pdf.name = "SimMatrix.pdf") 
```

#### Arguments
```
  speciesDAoutput  character                                REQUIRED speciesDA.jar output file (.txt format). See http://www.indriid.com/software.html, Species Delimitation Analyzer. This program takes species trees as input, and outputs clustering solutions.
  summarized.tree  character    NULL                        SEMI-OPTIONAL nexus-formatted tree file from which the topology is read, which is used to order the similarity matrix accordingly. File is read using the ape::read.nexus() function. This argument MUST be specified if <ownorder> is NULL.
  labelfile        character    NULL                        OPTIONAL file where the labels used in <summarized.tree> [FIRST column in <labelfile>] are referenced to labels used for the similarity matrix plot [SECOND column in <labelfile>]. Column header expected. All tips need to be included in this table. Their order is not important (will be ordered according to <summarized.tree>). If <labelfile> is specified, uses the labels specified in the SECOND column of the <labelfile> for plotting.
  
  ownorder         numeric      NULL                        If NULL, ordering will be performed automatically based on the topoplogy of <summarized.tree>. If a numeric vector of length equalling the number of tips, ordering will be performed using the manual ordering specification: the first index comes in the top left corner of the plot, etc.
  ownlines         numeric      NULL                        If NULL, line drawing will be performed automatically based on the <PP.thresh> criterion. If a numeric vector of length equalling the number of lines, line drawing will be performed using the manual line specification: the first line is drawn below the the first index, etc.
  PP.thresh        numeric      0.05                        Posterior probability threshold to draw a line between clades if <ownlines> = NULL. For each grid point along the diagonal in the pairwise distance matrix, it is assessed whether the posterior probability in the grid square below/to the right of that grid point is equal to or lower than PP.thresh. If yes, a line will be drawn to delineate species clades.
  
  mar              numeric      c(0,10,10,1)                numeric vector of lenght 4 specifying the plot margins below (1), to the left (2), to the top (3) and to the right (4) of the plot.
  label.size       numeric      1                           numeric giving the size of labels on x and y axes.
  legendlabel.size numeric      1                           numeric giving the size of labels next to the color legend.
  
  cols             color vector c("blue","orange","white")  color vector of length >=2 containing valid R colors to which low and high similarity indices are mapped to.
  border.col       color        NULL                        color vector of length 1 containing a valid R color specifying the border color of all plotted rectangles. If NULL, the borders will have the same color as the rectangles.
  legend           logical      TRUE                        If TRUE, the color legend will be plotted.
  
  plot.phylo       logical      FALSE                       If TRUE and <summarized.tree> is specified, a phylogram of <summarized.tree> will be plotted before the similarity matrix.
  save.pdf         logical      FALSE                       If TRUE, a .pdf file with the similarity matrix plot named <pdf.name> will be saved.
  pdf.name         character    SimMatrix.pdf               File name for output file (should have extension ".pdf")
```

### TUTORIAL on how to use the plot.simmatrix() function ###
############################################################

## First, make sure that your R working directory is located at this script's location:
# setwd("~/YourName/YourProject/smtools-master/SpeciesDelimitation")

## Specify your input data
# this is the example data (have a look at how these files look like), replace with your own data
# paths are relative to your R working directory
speciesDAoutput <- "STACEY/speciesDAoutput.txt"
summarized.tree <- "STACEY/species.sumtree"
labelfile <- "STACEY/labels.txt"

###############################################

## Check that input files exist
stopifnot(file.exists("plot.simmatrix.R")) # required
stopifnot(file.exists(speciesDAoutput))    # required
file.exists(summarized.tree)               # semi-optional (see below)
file.exists(labelfile)                     # optional (see below)

## Load R function into environment
source("plot.simmatrix.R")

## Inspect R funciton
args(plot.simmatrix) # arguments allow for a lot of fine-tuning
plot.simmatrix # read the Usage section if unsure about the arguments

## Some examples
# automatic ordering [according to <summarized.tree> topology] and line drawing [according to PP.thresh = 0.0]
